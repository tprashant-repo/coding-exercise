Requirements: 

You are asked by the sales team to make a tool to run a report on csv file generated by a customer. The file contains 3 columns consisting of id, foo, and bar. The sales team wants to know the total count of foo’s and bar’s when they are equal to 1. If foo and bar are both 1 they want this counted separately as ‘foobar’. They need to run this report multiple times and would like a simple command line interface to feed it the file’s path.  

Input File Example: 

id,foo,bar 
0,0,1 
1,1,0 
2,0,0 
3,0,1 
4,1,1 

Expected output: 

foo: 1 
bar: 2 
foobar: 1 

BUILD:
javac csvParser.java

RUN:
java csvParser test.csv
